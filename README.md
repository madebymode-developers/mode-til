This site was open sourced as a window into our development process, as well as
to allow people to experiment with the site on their own and contribute the
project.

### Install

If you are creating your own version of the site, fork the repository. Then,
follow these setup steps:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/madebymode/mode-til
$ cd mode-til
$ bundle install
$ rake db:setup
$ cp config/application.yml{.example,}
$ rails s
```

Authentication is managed by Omniauth and Google. To whitelist a domain or multiple domains, add the domain name to your environmental variables:

```yml
# config/application.yml

permitted_domains: 'madebymode.com|modevisual.com'
```

With this in place, you can visit '/admin' and log in with an email address from
the domain you've allowed.

### Dependencies

The `selenium-webdriver` gem requires the Firefox browser.

### Hosting
